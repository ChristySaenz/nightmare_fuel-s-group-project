# Project Proposal

We at Nightmare Fuel are focusing on the reproductive health of women around the world. We wish to analyze the countries around the world and how they handle the nuanced field of childbirth and how many counties establish a safe environment to reduce maternal mortality rates and childbirth and cost efficiency in general.

Resources:

Our goal at Nightmare Fuel is to examine the existence of correlations between access to health care, access to skilled medical professionals, and the mortality rates during childbirth throughout the world. This information could ideally be utilized to inform social policy reform surrounding health care systems as they relate to maternal care.
